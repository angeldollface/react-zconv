***Convert between different number systems using React. :ribbon: :rocket: :heart_on_fire: :unicorn: :nail_care:***

## ABOUT :books:

A while back I wrote a library that provides functions to convert between numbers of base 2 and base 10. This library is live on NPM and can be viewed [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zeppo). I decided to make a shiny frontend. The library was called ***Zeppo***, after the third Marx brother. This shiny frontend using the library is therefore called ***Z***eppo ***Conv***ert written in Vue.js 3. This is my implementation of the same app but in Raect.js.

## DEPLOYED PROJECT ON GITHUB PAGES :rocket:

To view a live deployed version of this project, click here: [VIEW](https://angeldollface.boo/react-zconv)

## USAGE :hammer:

***React ZConv*** makes your life very easy. It provides you with two conversion modes, one for converting from base 10 numbers to base 2 numbers and one from converting from base 2 numbers to base 10 numbers. The first is called `dec` and the second is called `bin`. To switch between modes, simply press the `Switch Mode` button. To convert from one base to the other, type your number into the input field and press `Compute`. That's it. But! If you type something wrong, you might get a nasty surprise. :wink:
